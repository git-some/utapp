			<p>A temperate to sub-tropical biome, vegetation types range from forests to woodlands, savannas, shrublands, and grasslands. "Mosaic" landscapes are common. Much of the woody vegetation in Mediterranean-climate regions is sclerophyll, which means 'hard-leaved' in Greek. Mediterranean eco-regions are semi-arid, and often have poor soils, so they are vulnerable to degradation by human land-use. These regions are also some of the most endangered on the planet, and many eco-regions have suffered tremendous degradation and habitat loss through logging, overgrazing, conversion to agriculture, urbanization, and introduction of exotic species. Many native plants and animals have become extinct or endangered with in these systems. Many of the plants are pyrophytes, or fire-loving, adapted or even depending on fire for reproduction. </p>

Golden Dewdrop is native to the Americas, from Mexico and the West Indies south to Argentina in South America. Its showy blossoms attract butterflies and hummingbirds.

Historically, the pulpy stem has been used to make a type of flour; however the Queen Sago has also been known to cause adverse neurological affects and paralysis. It is native to equatorial Africa.</p>

			<p>Bonsai (Japanese: literally "potted plant") is the art of miniaturization of trees by restraining their growth to an aesthetic ideal. Cultivation includes techniques for pruning, wiring, grafting, defoliation, deadwood, leaf trimming, watering, and repotting in various styles of containers.</p>
			<p>'Bonsai' is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai. The word bonsai is used in the West as an umbrella term for all miniature trees, but traditionally should be applied only to container-grown trees following the Japanese tradition.</p>

			<p>The UCF's cypress dome, at the corner of Gemini Boulevard and North Orion Boulevard is a lush, five-acre wetland plagued with an invasive species named the skunk vine. The vines are of a non-native predatory plant that, if left unchecked, will strangle the native cypress and other plant life out of its habitat. Since the construction of Gemini Blvd, the cypress dome has been overrun with the vine, a problem that has needed constant attention. It is similar to kudzu, a vine in the Appalachian Mountains, which can sweep literally every square inch of the side of a mountain, from the forest floor to the tops of trees. They report more than 10 invasive species on campus, ranging from small, isolated incidents to full-blown, widespread infestations such as the skunk vine, and they anticipate having their hands full well into the future.</p>

			<p style="width:475px;">On the roof of the Towers 2 residential hall, UCF installed a solar thermal system, which heats water with the sun's energy.  This system provides hot water for the 500 residents living in the building, reduces the need for electricity, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

By capitalizing on these off peak rates, the tank produces close to $700,000 in savings for the University and helps the utility company manage its peak load.</p>

			<p style="width:455px;">High atop the Student Union rests a garden that soaks in rainwater, beautifies UCF's campus and saves energy costs. As part of a research study by the UCF Stormwater Management Academy and the state Department of Environmental Protection, the green roof that crowns the building provides a visual and environmental appeal. UCF hopes to set a trend for other universities and businesses to take on environmentally responsible practices such as green roofs, which create both economic and social benefits while protecting valued natural resources. While the green roof clearly reduces heating and cooling expenses, pinpointing the amount of savings is difficult because heating, ventilation and air conditioning expenses cannot easily be separated for sections of the addition covered by the two types of roofs. If the experiment continues to go well and the community embraces the idea, the university will consider installing green roofs on other buildings and creating one that allows public access.</p>

		<p>This map app, named Knight's Earth, was inspired by the Unifying Theme of UCF focused on the environmental and global climate change:Our Planet. Our Education. Our Future. It became apparent how necessary it is to connect the everyday person with  UCF's energy conservation, sustainability, and environmental research, initiatives, and facilities on campus. This app will allow you to access most up to date and location specific information available at your fingertips by putting the information in your hands if you are walking around campus with your mobile device or allowing remote exploration through the map web site. In collaboration with UCF Departments such as Sustainability &amp; Energy Management, faculty, staff, and student organizations we were able to compile the latest statistics and photographs which enhances your UCF experience. New, exciting developments in our environmental programs and easy ways that students can make a positive impact on their environment are easily lost when the information is hard to find. However modern technology has the power to transform small hand-held smart devices and websites into interactive learning tools that can be used to guide yourself around UCF's campus and to greater environmental awareness.</p>
		<p>We hope our research will equip you, the everyday user and visitor with relevant environmental knowledge enhanced with a visual map. Similar technology and dedicated interdisciplinary research can help us to manage and monitor our environmental impact at a large metropolitan university such as UCF. This in turn will reduce the risks associated with waste, global climate change, air and water quality, chemical health hazards that plague our environment and our daily lives. This will highlight UCF's commitment to becoming a leader in energy and environmental sustainability, thus bringing together the UCF community centered on our pledge to be climate-neutral by 2050. Go Knights!</p>

			<li><p>Did you know that UCF spends over $1 million a month for electricity?  So educating and encouraging students, faculty, and staff members to save energy can have a significant impact on the University's finances and will reduce its environmental impact.</p></li>
		    <li><p>All new construction at UCF will meet or exceed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system's Silver certification.</p></li>
		    <li><p>The University aims to get all major educational buildings ENERGY STAR certified and then Leadership in Energy &amp; Envrironmental Design (LEED) Existing Building: Operations and Maintenance certified by 2045, at the latest.</p></li>  
		    <li><p>UCF's goal is to reach a 75% recycling rate by 2020.</p></li>
		    <li><p>The University of Central Florida (UCF) may be the only university in the U.S. with a quirky, solar-electric fleet vehicle in daily use that runs solely on solar energy. The department of Sustainability &amp; Energy Management purchased an electric vehicle in 2008 and retrofitted it with solar panels.  The rooftop solar panels have successfully maintained the vehicle charge to date.  This means no fuel, no plugging in, and no emissions for close to 3,000 miles so far; a nearly carbon neutral mode of transportation for UCF!  Keep an eye out for "Sunny" as it drives by!</p></li>         
		    <li><p>Green roofs have multiple benefits including: reducing heat loss; decreasing stormwater pollutants; lessening stormwater runoff volume; absorbing carbon dioxide; and providing habitat for wildlife.</p></li>
		    <li><p>Since 2007, UCF has participated in Recyclemania, an inter-collegiate competition for university recycling programs.  </p></li>
		    <li><p>UCF is committed to reducing its use of harmful chemicals and using environmentally friendly cleaning products.   </p></li>
		    <li><p>Many departments have encouraged their faculty and staff members to reduce their paper consumption.  For example, the College of Business Administration's faculty have placed their exams online and its advising office does on-screen graduation audits.  As such, during the 2008-2009 academic year, more than 130,000 exams were taken online which saved approximately 2,700 reams of paper.</p></li>  
		    <li><p>The first university Senior Design Symposium on renewable and sustainable energy in America was held at UCF in 2009.  Undergraduate seniors in engineering and computer science showcased design projects that involved renewable &amp; sustainable energy.</p></li>
		    <li><p>UCF has more than 82 acres of natural lands, 3 miles of hiking trails, and a community garden for all to enjoy.  </p></li>

		<p>Did you know that those that utilize the shuttles and public transportation reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 690 pounds per year? Did you know that you can easily cut your carbon dioxide emissions by 500 pounds per year when carpooling? One might also consider a more physical alternative to the routine drive to campus. Biking, skateboarding, and walking will not only reduce your carbon emission by 2,220 pounds per year but also give you an excellent, daily work-out at the same time!</p>
