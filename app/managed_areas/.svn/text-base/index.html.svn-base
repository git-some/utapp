<h1>Landscape and Natural Resource  Educational</h1>
<p>Mission: The Department of Landscape  &amp; Natural Resources is committed to planning, installing and maintaining a sustainable and inviting outdoor environment for the UCF campus, providing  shade, visual interest, and healthy ecosystem function in both the constructed  and natural areas. LNR is responsible for the maintenance, landscape  installation and irrigation, and management of all university grounds,  excluding sports turf. Our watchword is sustainability: appropriate plants,  tended with the best management practices, and proper management of greenspace  on campus.</p>

By establishing a peer to peer  educational program based around the local native Florida ecology, LNR can further promote, sustain, and instill the important historic and present value  of our natural lands that makes up 44% of the UCF campus.</p>

  Here are three of some  of the most iconic animal <br>
  species that have  evolved to survive and cope <br>
  with the diverse Florida  ecotypes that are present <br>
  throughout the entire  state of Florida and UCF <br>
  Campus. One important  species in particular, <br>
  the <u>Gopher Tortoise,</u> is known as a keystone <br>
  species or a species  that is crucial or essential to <br>
  the species community.  Without the Gopher <br>
  Tortoise and it's  intricate borrow systems, many <br>
  other native species  would not be successful at<br>
  surviving Florida natural fires, hiding or <br>
  evading predators.</p>

<p> In an effort to  restore a diverse plant species community, Landscape and Natural Resources  performs a yearly, native grass and shrub seeding. By spreading native shrub  and grass seed among the understory of a restoration site, other nonnative  plant species will have a harder time at  successfully establishing on restored area , which can further promote these  native plant species and eventually help increase the native plant and animal  biodiversity, around the UCF community. </p>

<p>In an effort to reduce energy  usage and rain water runoff from a building, <u>UCF Landscape and Natural  Resources</u> has teamed up with the <u>Sustainability and Energy Management  Department</u> on campus to create and maintain a native plant species green  roof. The departments use high tech monitoring systems that record and evaluate  the data being collected on the roof to show that the building is actually  saving money and reducing untreated rain water run-off.</p>

<p>***Fire creates and maintains plant and animal habitats  throughout the United States, and many ecosystems would not exist in the  absence of fire. Fire creates change, which is biologically necessary to  maintain healthy ecosystems. For example, fire-dependent trees, such as sand  pines, drop their cones which open with intense fire. Without fire, these trees  will not grow and reproduce.<u></u></p>
